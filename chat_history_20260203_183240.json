Grasped basic Pygame display setup, event handling, variables, conditionals, `pygame.Rect` manipulation, and initial vertical movement. Proficient with basic keyboard input and function modularization. Teacher notes indicate a conceptual gap in understanding multi-directional acceleration and deceleration, particularly the explicit connection between velocity values and position updates, and proper frame rate control with `pygame.time.Clock.tick()`. Last homework note indicates student did well on basic platform collision and is ready for world scrolling and a review of `clock.tick`.\n\n        Class Name: World Scrolling: Player Stays, World Moves\n        Relevance: Introduce the concept of a game world larger than the screen. Learn how to simulate camera movement by keeping the player centered and moving the background elements (like platforms) in response to player input, understanding the difference between screen and world coordinates. This class also reinforces the critical role of `pygame.time.Clock.tick()` in maintaining consistent game speed, addressing previous learning gaps.\n        Methods: ['Differentiating between screen coordinates (fixed window positions) and world coordinates (positions within a large, scrollable map)', \"Implementing a `camera_offset_x` variable to track the world's horizontal scroll position\", 'Calculating screen positions for static game objects (e.g., platforms) by subtracting `camera_offset_x` from their `world_x` position', \"Adjusting `camera_offset_x` based on player movement to simulate the camera following the player, while the player's `rect.x` remains relatively centered on screen\", \"Reviewing and applying `pygame.time.Clock.tick(FPS)` to ensure smooth scrolling and consistent game speed, preventing 'out of control' movement previously observed\"]\n        Stretch Methods: ['Implementing `camera_offset_y` for vertical scrolling based on player vertical movement or scene changes', 'Introducing background parallax scrolling by drawing background layers at different scroll rates']\n        Skills Tested: Introduce the concept of a game world larger than the screen. Learn how to simulate camera movement by keeping the player centered and moving the background elements (like platforms) in response to player input, understanding the difference between screen and world coordinates. This class also reinforces the critical role of `pygame.time.Clock.tick()` in maintaining consistent game speed, addressing previous learning gaps.\n        Description: 46\n\n        Classwork:\n\n        None\n\n\n        he did alright in class; he understood how coordinates actually work and how to sort of programmtically decide where they go (u can put this in taught_methods) but he didnt really do much of the above except conceptual understanding so let's extend it to another class\n\n        Notes on Class: Student demonstrated a good conceptual understanding of how coordinates function in a game environment. While foundational understanding of differentiating between screen and world coordinates is present, practical implementation of world scrolling mechanics, including tracking camera offset, calculating object screen positions, and adjusting camera based on player movement, will be further developed in upcoming sessions. We will also revisit the application of `pygame.time.Clock.tick()` to ensure consistent game speed.\n        \n            Taught Methods: ['Differentiating between screen coordinates (fixed window positions) and world coordinates (positions within a large, scrollable map)']\n            \n            Stretch Methods: [\"Implementing a `camera_offset_x` variable to track the world's horizontal scroll position\", 'Calculating screen positions for static game objects (e.g., platforms) by subtracting `camera_offset_x` from their `world_x` position', \"Adjusting `camera_offset_x` based on player movement to simulate the camera following the player, while the player's `rect.x` remains relatively centered on screen\", \"Reviewing and applying `pygame.time.Clock.tick(FPS)` to ensure smooth scrolling and consistent game speed, preventing 'out of control' movement previously observed\"]\n            "

Your player character should be able to move left and right using keyboard input.\n2.  Instead of the player moving all the way to the edges of the screen, the *game world* (like platforms) should shift left or right, giving the illusion that the player is moving through a larger area.\n3.  The player character should mostly stay centered horizontally on the screen as the world scrolls around them.\n4.  You *must* use a `camera_offset_x` variable to keep track of how much the world has moved.\n5.  Use `pygame.time.Clock.tick(FPS)` to ensure your game scrolls at a consistent, smooth speed, preventing it from going too fast or too slow.\n\n**Your Challenge:**\nImagine your player is on an epic journey through a wide, scrolling landscape filled with platforms. Your mission is to program a game window where your player can walk across a vast world that extends beyond the screen. As your player moves, make the background elements, like platforms, slide by, creating the feeling that you're exploring new territory. The key is to keep your player feeling like the star, staying pretty much in the middle, while the whole world does the moving!\n\n**Ideas to spark creativity:**\n-   Design a unique path of platforms that stretches far off the screen – maybe some are high, some are low, or even some have gaps!\n-   Add a special \"goal\" item (like a treasure chest or a flag) far to the right in your world coordinates, and make it scroll into view as the player gets closer.\n-   Experiment with adding a simple background element (like a distant hill or cloud) that also scrolls, just like your platforms.\n-   Try making your player jump! If your player can jump, make sure the platforms still scroll correctly when they land.\n\n**Remember:**\n-   The `camera_offset_x` variable is super important – it's how you tell everything in your world to shift!\n-   When drawing your platforms or other world objects, you'll need to subtract `camera_offset_x` from their actual `world_x` position to get their `screen_x` position.\n-   `pygame.time.Clock.tick(FPS)` is your game's \"pacemaker\" – use it to control the game's speed and ensure smooth scrolling.\n-   Have fun seeing how a little bit of code can make a huge world come to life!"
